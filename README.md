# TravelSmart: Hybrid for Personalized Tourist Recommendations

In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically transformed many different industries, including the travel sector. The large amount of travel information available online these days is both an advantage and a challenge: travelers are likely to become bored when looking through information on media platforms, which might prevent them from making the best decision. Recommendation systems have become an effective tool for improving user experience by offering customized recommendations based on unique tastes and behavior in order to address the problem. Based on the application of the big data recommendation system in the movie app [1], the method of constructing a big data recommendation system suitable for the industry such as e-commerce, tourism, medical treatment, and education is summarized, and the significance of the research of the big data recommendation system is analyzed. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how recommender systems can automatically organize product arrangements based on users' browsing behaviors. These systems analyze patterns and preferences to tailor the display of products to individual users. Although recommender systems have achieved substantial progress and have become integral to many online platforms, there are still areas that need improvement. Enhancements are required to refine their accuracy, adaptability, and overall effectiveness to ensure they meet and exceed customer expectations, ultimately leading to higher levels of user satisfaction.
